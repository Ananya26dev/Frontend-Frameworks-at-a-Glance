This is a web-based project displaying information about popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries: React, Vue, Angular, and JQuery. Each framework is presented in a card format with a red header for the title, a description, and a "Read more" button for further details.

The layout suggests a visually appealing design with distinct sections highlighted by colors (e.g., green header/footer). The cards appear consistent and structured for quick readability.
